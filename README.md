#unitconverter-android

This was an independent study project for an Elgin Community College Computer Science course.
The goal was to learn the basics of Android development by writing a fairly simple application.

The application is a simple unit conversion tool, hence the name. 
It was targeted to Andriod 2.2, so it is quite old at this point and should not be used.
